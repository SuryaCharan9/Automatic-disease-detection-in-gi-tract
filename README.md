# Automatic-disease-detection-in-gi-tract
image processing techniques to aid automatic disease detection.
 We used Fine-tuning ResNet with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning to train our model.
 All the code is compatible in both python2 and python 3.
 classification folder has the code which can be executed either in collab or on jupyter notebook.
 libraries has to be installed on jupyter whereas on collab they are preinstalled.
 incase of any missing module write command !pip install (module-name)
 training and test data folders have data whose path has to be specified in code.
